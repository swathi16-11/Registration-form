# Registration-form
I recently built a simple and responsive Contact Form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This project includes:

✔️ Real-time input validation
✔️ Clean and minimal user interface
✔️ Fully responsive across all devices

It’s a small step in my web development journey, but each error I faced helped me learn something new.
